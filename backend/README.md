# AVS Backend System

This project is the backend for an AVS network compiler that transforms high-level design configurations into deployable artifacts. It integrates an IR compiler, a Hygen-based code generation engine, a deployment orchestrator, and monitoring modules. The system supports integrations with Othentic (governance/consensus), P2P messaging, Gaia (AI analysis), and Tangle (immutable logging).
